					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am currently student s3922276 at RMIT university in my first year of doing a Bachelor of Information Technology. I graduated year 12 in 2020 studying and finishing VCE with an ATAR of 76. I am an Australian citizen and i was born at Monash Hospital Morrabin on the 13th of September 2002 making me currently 18 years old. My religion is buddhist and in my household we speak Vietnamese.

A hobby of mine is that I like playing video games such as first person shooters. Recently I have been playing a lot of Valorant and currently i sit at the rank of Diamond 1. I enjoy playing these games because of the satisfaction I get from winning games aswell as spending time with my friends and also improving my own gameplay. Furthermore, I started playing AFL football at the age of 10 for the Noble Park Bulls and continued this journey until I was 18 at Burnside Heights Football Club. Due to obtaining many injuries such as a broken ankle aswell as getting four concussions the doctors recommended that I stopped playing contact sports. This lead me to play in another area of sports which was Netball which I excelled in being able to achieve best and fairest in all three of the seasons which I played in aswell as being able to play in two grand finals and winning one.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> I am interested in IT as it is constantly evolving and there is so much more potential that is possible through the use of technology being designed. My interest in IT started when I was young because my parents had just introduced me to my first gaming device which was the gameboy. Further on as my device got older, I was introduced to the DS aswell as a Playstation 2. This sparked my interest in IT because these various consoles have developed and changed drastically over time such as improves graphics aswell as performance. All of this loops back to my interest in IT because I am very passionate about gaming and enjoy playing games in my spare time. Additionally, this got me interested on how technology that looks so simple is made such as through coding and many more.

I decided to study at RMIT because there was many recommendations from my friends as they have previously studied here aswell as the convient location of the campus which is located in Melbourne City. Furthermore, after graduating from year 12 I spoke to my school councellors and they recommended that I go to RMIT as it is a university skilled in teaching IT. Through all of this I decided to do some research before applying to universities and RMIT actually has a lot of advanced technologies available to students. Obviously, as RMIT is an institute of Technology it was pretty clear to me that it was a good choice in selecting RMIT as my choice of university. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to go into more depth as to how technology is programmed to do what it does or how simple machines are able to have a greater purpose.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>According to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator I am an entertainer. This means that I am very energetic and enjoy the moment aswell as helping others feel the same way. Celebrities which are entertainers consist of Adele, Marilyn Monroe and Jamie Oliver and I feel like I relate to these people in a sense because I enjoy entertaining others through having a conversation or physical activity. Personally, I like to help people with their personal problems as I am very confident in my ability to speak and understand individuals, however, according to the Myers Briggs Test it suggests that entertainers don't enjoy helping other people as they don't want to be apart of conflict. I feel like i differ becauase I dont see it as being apart of conflict but rather a challenge or problem that I can solve or help with. It is true that I am more focused on pleasuring myself rather then completing tasks and this is because it seems more fun to do the things that I enjoy. I am not surprised that I was given the personaility of a entertainer because I do enjoy having fun in life through socialising or more own pleasures</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>Boldness which means I like to experience life and am eager to face new challenges.

People skills meaning I am able to interact and communicate with other individuals.</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>Sensitive so I take things personally and I dislike criticism which is shown through my emotions.

Easily bored and so i require a lot of entertainment.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>In a team I think being an entertainer is beneficial as I am able to lift the teams energy allowing us to complete tasks fasters as people are more motivated to do tasks. Furthermore, through my communication skills I am able to guide other team members on what do to aswell as assign people to different jobs and appoint a deadline aswell as schedule a time where the team should have a meeting to discuss any challenges to see if anybody needs help. However, a disadvantage of being a entertainer is that I may cause distractions in the team as I may be too excited and bring in too much fun for the team and so we will be distracted and unable to complete tasks.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>According to the Learning Preferences Test I am a tactile person. This means that I learn better by actually doing the activity and so I am more of a hands on person. I take a lot of breaks because I am very active when learning and so it is difficult for me not to be fidgety when studying. In a group setting I encourage others through physical touch such as applauding or patting someone on the back because I find it as a more efficient way to connect to teammates because it allows for stronger relationships to be built as we are closer.</p>

					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
					<p>According to the Big 5 Factors test I was put in the category Extroversion with a score percentage of 67. This means that I am energetic because I am very active and eager to participate in social events. Being able to participate in social events means that I enjoy interacting with others so I can meet new friends aswell as understanding different perspectives of life. I am also friendly and approachable so it is easy for people to have a chat with me or approach me for any help. A weak factor of mine is my emotional stableness which as a percentage of 26. This is because I am a very sensitive person and certain things that people do can hurt my feelings and put me down. Usually in these situations I will be unmotivated to do any activities and tend to lay in bed feeling bad about myself which is not a good characterisitics because it makes it seem as though I give up easily</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The project idea which I would like to create is a smartphone app that allows for security measures in the house. This app would allow the user to be able to tab into security cameras. The security cameras will be able to be accessed by the user showing live footage and also provides and alarm system which would allow the user to contact the closest police department for any suspicious activities. Furthermore, the user would be able to open and close doors and windows around the household as well as being able to lock and unlock them.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This project idea would be useful because due to advances technologies it would allow for a lower rate of crime rates around the world because through this app it would allow for the police department to be contacted so that they are on site to a robbery as soon as possible. Furthermore, through a manual locking system through a touch of a button because the user might have forgotten to lock the door this would prevent intruders from simply walking inside of their household and by the time that they are able to get inside the house the cameras would have detected movement and alerted the user through the app.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The project idea is to design a security system for around the household which would consist of cameras and locks. The cameras would be placed around the household to the users liking and would be able to provide live footage to the app on what is currently happening during the moment. If the user is not on the app, they would be alerted if there are any suspicious activities happening in the area. Furthermore, the lock system would be able to detect and alert the user if it has been tampered with and would automatically lock itself if the user has left the house and had forgotten to lock it. This would also alert the user to remind them that the door has been automatically locked. This system would operate through a plug which connects to any power plug around the house. There will also be a pack up battery which would temporarily be used if there is a blackout or power outage around the household. The camera would be able to record footage and keep it safely stored for 24 hours which it will then delete and update with the new camera footage. The project would be sold in a set with 4 cameras and 4 locks with simple instructions on how to install and connect that app to the cameras within the household.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Hardware that would be used be the physical camera which would be programmed by software allowing users to watch live footage of what is currently happening through their app on their smartphone. Other equipment required would be a backup battery which would allow the camera to be used during a blackout or power outage as it would be an additional and temporary source of power for the system to operate.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>A software engineer will be required to help design and implement the necessary software allowing the cameras to operate and provide live footage to the user via the app. Furthermore, someone experienced with GitHub will be required as they will be able to save and store footage provided by the camera as well as being able to use and allow users to access camera footage as well as being able to lock doors automatically if the user as left the premises.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project idea is successful it would allow for users to feel safer in and out of their household knowing that they will be able to have extra security measures around the household. This would also likely decrease the rates of house robberies because the app would be able to alert the police department if there is any suspicious activity and so the police would be able to be on site as soon as possible.</p>
